Code for:
* Boundary Decomposition for Nadir Objective Vector Estimation, NeurIPS 2024 (Accepted). This paper provides a general framework for approximating/exactly finding the nadir objective vector.
* Boundary Decomposition for Finding Nadir Objective Vector in Multi-Objective Discrete Optimization, AAAI 2025 (Accepted). Implementation for discrete problems. The proposed method is exact if an exact single-objective optimization solver is available.
